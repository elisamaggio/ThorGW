# Quasinormal modes of slowly spinning horizonless compact objects

In this repository, there are the boundary conditions describing slowly spinning horizonless compact objects under axial and polar perturbations.

This research is supported by the European Union’s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 101107586 "Testing the horizon of black holes with gravitational waves".
